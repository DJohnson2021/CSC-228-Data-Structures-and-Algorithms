# CSC-228-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
Project for Data Structures and Algorithms class. 
Environmental Justice.
This project was completed with the idea of looking at the topic of Environmental Justice from a different angle instead of focusing on areas like climate change and polution. The application focuses on endangered species as a topic. The application allows the user to perform simple tasks such as displaying, searching, sorting, and deleting information. This project is to be used as starting point for future additions to the application to make it more advanced.
